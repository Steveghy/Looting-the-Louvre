Welcome to Looting the Louvre! - Team ID: 2068

As the theme was "an arcade game for a museum", our team thought we should base our
game around the Lourve, located in Paris, France. It's arguably the most popular art
museum in the world, with multiple historical paintings, including the Mona Lisa.
Looting the Lourve will educate younger kids about important works of art without needing
to wander through a "boring" museum.
